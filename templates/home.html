        This webpage is my submission as the final project for the <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50x</a> course.
    </p>
    <p>
        This small webpage is coded in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, running on the Python Flask framework.
    </p>
    <p>
        It contains a <a href="#">book selector</a>, which leads to two other pages: an excerpt of my <a href="{{ url_for('diary')}}">personal diary</a> and a selection of <a href="#">other writings.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the <a href="#">about</a> page, you can get to know a little bit about me as well!
